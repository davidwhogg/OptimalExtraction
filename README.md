## Projects
- **Never divide by the flat:** This project was obviated by a prior paper by Zechmeister *et al* on "Flat-relative optimal extraction".
- **What if the LSF doesn't perfectly align with the ccd pixel grid?** We have an iterative solution that preserves the simplicity or tractability of OE or FROE but solves this problem.
